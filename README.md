# Infoaidtech-2-Temperature_convertor
In this project the aim is to develop a temperature converter in java with swing.
Swing in java : In Java, you can create graphical user interfaces (GUI) using the Swing framework.
Swing provides a set of components and classes that allow you to create windows, buttons, text fields, and other GUI elements.
Step1: A interface window to display and do conversion in temperatures using java.
Step2: Then perform event action for every table on textbox created in the design file 
Step3: After completing the logic for the input box then finally 
Step4: Run the intetface file in which the code has written with the design action
step5: Now can run the file then the design window will open
Step6: User can enter the integer input and get the valid converted temperature
Step7: And the design has a exit buttton to end up!!
